# Dynamic Web Page with Navigation, Media, and Footer

This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic web page using JavaScript to add and style HTML elements, including a header, navigation menu, main content with an image and embedded video, and a footer. The page is styled using inline CSS.

## Features

- **Header**: A header element is created and styled with a background color and centered text.
- **Navigation Menu**: A navigation menu with links to "Home", "Contact", "Login", "Register", and "Help" is created. The menu is styled with a background color, padding, and text alignment.
- **Main Content Area**: 
  - Left section (`aside`) with an image of the Palau de les Arts Opera House in Valencia.
  - Right section (`section`) with an embedded YouTube video.
- **Footer**: A footer section with a "Thank You" message.
  
## Files

- **index.html**: The HTML structure that links the JavaScript and dynamically adds elements to the page.
- **task1.js**: The JavaScript file that dynamically generates and styles the HTML elements.
- **CSS (Inline in JS)**: The styles are applied directly in the JavaScript file.
